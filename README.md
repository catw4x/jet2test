# jet2test

I created a simple HTML page with some javascript to open and close a modal. I also created a SASS file for the CSS and used this to design the page mobile first and to then make the page responsive for desktop. I only used 1 image for the logo and just css and fontawesome for the buttons and modal success icon.

I set up the modal to be empty so that it can be re-used with different messages being passed in.

I really enjoyed this test. I am fairly new to SASS but I love the functionality it gives you. I dont think I will ever go back to plain CSS now!
